# ALBADross: Active Learning Based Anomaly Diagnosis for Production HPC Systems

![The high-level architecture of ALBADRoss](figures/albadross_high_level.png)

Diagnosing causes of performance variations in High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems is a daunting challenge due to the systems' scale and complexity. Variations in application performance result in premature job termination, lower energy efficiency, or wasted computing resources. One potential solution is manual root-cause analysis based on system telemetry data. However, this approach has become an increasingly time-consuming procedure as the process relies on human expertise and the size of telemetry data is voluminous. Recent research employs supervised machine learning (ML) models to diagnose previously encountered performance anomalies in compute nodes automatically. However, these models generally necessitate vast amounts of labeled samples that represent anomalous and healthy states of an application during training. The demand for labeled samples is constraining because gathering labeled samples is difficult and costly, especially considering anomalies that occur infrequently.

This paper proposes a novel active learning-based framework that diagnoses previously encountered performance anomalies in HPC systems using significantly fewer labeled samples compared to state-of-the-art ML-based frameworks. Our framework combines an active learning-based query strategy and a supervised classifier to minimize the number of labeled samples required to achieve a target performance score. We evaluate our framework on a production HPC system and a testbed HPC cluster using real and proxy applications. We show that our framework, ALBADross, achieves a 0.95 F1-score using 28x fewer labeled samples compared to a supervised approach with equal F1-score, even when there are previously unseen applications and application inputs in the test dataset.

## Installation

Install the requirements. The most stable Python version is 3.6.5. However, it works with 3.7x and 3.8x as well. Please note that we didn't test the code with Python 3.9x.


1-) Create a local virtual environment in the folder

```
python3 -m venv ml_venv
```

2-) Activate venv

```
source ml_venv/bin/activate/
```

3-) Install requirements

```
pip3 install --user -r albadross_reqs.txt
```
